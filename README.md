# hackpackpong

A quick hacked version of pong that plays against itself.
I installed my display incorrectly (and it was easier to change the code than find different wires), so some of the code purposely mixes up the x and y look-up coordinates of the matrix.

Each paddle will track the ball depending on which part of the paddle it has randomly chosen to hit with. Depending on which pixel is hit on the paddle affects the velocity and angle of the ball.
